# Source Code for "Exploring Noisy Quantum Thermodynamical Processes via the Depolarizing-Channel Approximation"

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used to perform numerical simulations and generate the figures presented in the manuscript.

## Repository Structure

The notebooks are organized according to the figures in the paper:

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Figure1_and_Figure_S3.ipynb` | Generates Figure 1 (Main Text) and Figure S3 (Supplement). |
| `FIG3.ipynb` | Generates Figure 3 (Main Text). |
| `FigS1.ipynb` | Generates Figure S1 (Supplement). |
| `FIG_S2.ipynb` | Generates Figure S2 (Supplement). |

## Installation and Requirements

The simulations are implemented in Python. To set up the environment and install necessary dependencies (including Qiskit, Qiskit-Aer, and the QuL library), please run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
